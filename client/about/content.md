# Freefeed Feeder

Feeder is an automated content sharing service built for [Freefeed](https://freefeed.net), an open source social network. Feeder can monitor RSS, ATOM, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr, or potentially any other web feed updates, normalize the content and share clean and readable excerpts on Freefeed.

Feeder was inspired by "Imaginary friends" feature from [Friendfeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed). There was ability to receive updates from a person, even if he or she don't have an account on Friendfeed. Feeder introduce the similar capability to Freefeed.
